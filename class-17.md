# jQuery, Events, and The DOM
jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed.

**SELECT ELEMENTS** It is simpler to access elements using jQuery's CSS-style selectors than it is using DOM queries. The selectors are also more powerful and flexible.

**PERFORM TASKS** jQuery's methods let you update the DOM tree, animate elements into and out of view, and loop through a set of elements, all in one line of code. 

**HANDLE EVENTS** jQuery includes methods that allow you to attach event listeners to selected elements without having to write any tailback code to support older browsers. 

jQuery is a JavaScript file you include in our pages.

Once included, it makes it faster and easier to write cross-browser JavaScript, based on two steps:
 - Using CSS-style selectors to collect one or more nodes from the DOM tree.
 - Using jQuery's built-in methods to work with the elements in that selection.
 
jQuery's CSS-style selector syntax makes it easier to select elements to work with. It also has methods that make it easier to traverse the DOM.

jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers. 

jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers commonly need to perform. 

## pair programming
pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. 
## How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
## Why pair program?
There are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: **Listening:** hearing and interpreting the vocabulary **Speaking:** using the correct words to communicate an idea **Reading:** understanding what written language intends to convey **Writing:** producing from scratch a meaningful

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness
