# SMACSS and Responsive Web Design 
## Responsive 
**Responsive web design** is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.


## Flexible Layouts
**Flexible layouts**, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. 


## Media Queries
**Media queries** were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. 


## Flexible Media
The final, equally important aspect to responsive web design involves **flexible media**. As viewports begin to change size media doesnâ€™t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.
