# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations
## CSS Transforms
The transform property comes in two different settings, **two-dimensional and three-dimensional**. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
- **Two-dimensional transforms** work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. 
- **Three-dimensional transforms** work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. 

## CSS Transitions, and Animations
### Transitions
For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.

### Animations
Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

### Customizing Animations
Animations also provide the ability to further customize an elementâ€™s behavior, including the ability to declare the number of times an animation runs, as well as the direction in which an animation completes.
