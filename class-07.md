# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions
## HTML Tables
- To add a table to our web page we use table element.
- To create a row of our table we use tr element.
- the cells of our table inside each row we create it by using td element or th element if it is a header.
- We can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. For long tables we can split the table into a thead, tbody, and tfoot elements.

## JS Constructor Functions
The process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem called DOM, and it can verify and validate your understanding of that problem. 

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

- We use functions to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task Instead of repeating them every time.
- Functions can take parameters and may return a value. 
The series of variables and functions that represent something called object.
- Web browsers excute the objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
