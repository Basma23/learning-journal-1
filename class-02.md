# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions
## HTML Text:
**There are two types of markup to write a text by using HTML:**
- **Structural markup:** all elements that we can use them to describe both headings and paragraphs.
- **Semantic markup:** all elements that provides extra information such as emphasis element, quotation element, and so on.
**So, we use the HTML elements to describe the structure of the page.**
## CSS Introduction:
**What is CSS?**

**CSS** is a shortcut of Cascading Style Sheet.So, it’s a styling language.

It’s deal with HTML code to design the structure of HTML. So, it’ll be appear with HTML pages when we link them together if we write our CSS code in external file.

It’s contain different types of selectors.

Declarations have tow parts one of the properties of the element which we need to change it, and the other one for the value of these properties.
## Basic JavaScript Instructions

# What is an expression? 

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. [1] 

**We have two types of expression and these are:**

- **EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE**

In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign).

- **EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE**

We can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value. 

# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS #

JavaScript contains mathematical operators, which we can use them with numbers. 

**Mathematical operators are:**

- **ADDITION** Adds one value to another.

- **SUBTRACTION** Subtracts one value from another.

- **DIVISION** Divides two values.

- **MULTIPLICATION** Multiplies two values using an asterisk.

- **INCREMENT** Adds one to the current number.

- **MODULUS** Divides two values and returns the remainder .

**ORDER OF EXECUTION**
There are several arithmetic operations we can performed them by one expression, but we must understand how the result will be calculated. Multiplication and division are performed first then addition or subtraction. 

**STRING OPERATOR**
In string operator we use + sign to join the strings on either side of it. Concatenation is  the process of joining two or more strings together to create one new string.

**MIXING NUMBERS AND STRINGS TOGETHER**

When we pot quotes around a number, it will be  a string, and we cannot perform addition operations on strings. 

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
# Declaring function 

**There are two ways to declaring function and they are:**

- To write a function we need to give it name related to our purpose to make others understand what we are doing, then we write our statement inside the curly braces, after our function we need to calling it to execute our statement.

- Some times we need to specify information for our function to execute its task, and to write this type it will be like this function, then its name, then between parenthesis our parameters, then curly braces, between them the parameters will act as variables. To calling this type of function we need to specify the arguments which they can provided as values or variables.
