# JS Debugging

## Error Handling & Debugging
- When we understand the execution contexts and stacks, we will be able to find the error in our code.
- The process of finding errors we called it **Debugging**.
- Console is helping us to find the location of the error.
- There are 7 different types of errors of JavaScript. Each one of them creates its own error object, that can tell us about its error line number and gives a description of that error. 
-  We can handle our errors gracefully by using the try, catch, and statements. We use them to give our users helpful feedback.
