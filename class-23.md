# SQL
**What is SQL?**

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

**Relational databases**

A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. So, it's structured to recognize relations among stored items of information.
