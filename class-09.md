# Forms and Events
## Form
- When we want to collect information from our visitors we will need to create a form, by using form element.
- The form is sent the information form in name/value pairs.
- We give a name for each form control, and the text that the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
## Lists, Tables & Forms
- There are several prperties that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
- We use the list-style-type and list-style image properties to give different appearances of list markers
- Table cells have different borders and spacing, but there are properties we can use them to control table cells and make them more consistent.
- If the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS, the forms will be easier to use.
## Events [1]
- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked). 
- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon. 
- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user. 
- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element. 
- The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.
