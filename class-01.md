# How Websites Are Created?
Each website depends on **HTML** and **CSS** codes to create it. 

We use HTML and CSS to create a **Static website**, but when we want to give a life for our website which we called it **Dynamic website** we need to use more programming languages such as JavaScript but when we take a look for E-Commerce websites, Amazone for example, we need to get data from users and store these data, to do that we need to mix between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP codes and so on.

## Structure 

HTML pages are considered as **text documents**.

HTML uses tags and the characters between angled brackets define the **meaning**.

Tags are often point to as **elements**.

Tags mostly have **opening tags** and **closing tags**.

Opening tags can contain **attributes** to tell us more about the content of that element.

Each attribute need a **name** and **value**. 

We should know what tags that we need them for our use, what they do, and where they can go when we want to learn HTML coding.

## Extra Markup 

When we write an HTML code we will start writing by DOCTYPES which tell browsers that which HTML version that we are using.


To add comments on our HTML to let other understand what are we doing on our code we write it like this **!-- our comment --** between angeld brackets.


We can add id and class attributes inside tags to identify particular elements.


To group block-level and inline elements together we use these tags: **div tag** and **span tag**.
  
  
To cut windows into our web pages through which other pages can be displayed we use this tag: **iframes tag**.
  
  
To supply all kinds of information about our page we use this tag: **meta tag**.

## HTML5 Layout 

The new elements of HTML5 point the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure, and provide clearer code. 

The older browsers which don't understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are blocklevel elements.

## Process & Design 
When we want to create our web pages we have to point to these points: **Who our audience? Why they would come to our site? What information they want to find? and When they are likely to return?**.


We should to sketch your web page how it will be look like, and we can use **Site Maps** which allows us to plan the strauctureof a site.


- To organize the information that we will need to go on each page we use **wireframes**.


- To help our visitors to understand what we are trying to tell them we use **visual hierarchy**.


- To coordinate our information on our web page we use **size, color, and style**.


- To make simple present of our information we can use **grouping and similarity**.

## What is JavaScript? 

The script consider as a set of instructions which the computer do the step by step or one by one to achieve a specific goal.

When we are running JavaScript it might only use a subset of all the instructions at each time. 

To deal with writing JavaScript code or script we should to determine our goal and break it down into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.

The better way to write JavaScript code is pot it in its own file like HTML code, and CSS code but the extension for it is .js, and we link it with HTML by using script tag inside body tag in HTML file,and when we render it, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because it deals with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
