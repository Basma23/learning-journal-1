# How Websites Are Created?
Each website depends on **HTML** and **CSS** codes to create it. 

We use HTML and CSS to create a **Static website**, but when we want to give a life for our website which we called it **Dynamic website** we need to use more programming languages such as JavaScript but when we take a look for E-Commerce websites, Amazone for example, we need to get data from users and store these data, to do that we need to mix between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP codes and so on.
