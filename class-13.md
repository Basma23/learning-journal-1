# Local Storage
The operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data like preferences or runtime state. These values may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files, or some other place according to platform convention. 

Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But there are three potentially dealbreaking downsides:
- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down our web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless our entire web application is served over SSL)
- Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down our application, but not enough to be terribly useful
So, we need to  a lot of storage space on the client that persists beyond a page refresh and isn’t transmitted to the server.

**“HTML5 Storage”** is a specification named Web Storage, which was at one time part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out into its own specification. Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.” The naming situation is made even more complicated by some related, similarly-named, emerging standards.

**HTML5 Storage** it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

**HTML5 Storage** is based on named key/value pairs. We store data based on a named key, then we can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If we are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, we will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.
