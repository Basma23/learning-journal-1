# JS Object Literals; The DOM
An object is cosidered as a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something.

Variables are the **properties** of an object.

Functions are the  **methods** of an object.

# The DOM
**DOM** is a shortcut of Document Object Model.

The browser appears the page using a DOM tree. 

There are four types of nodes of DOM trees: 
**document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes**. 

**To select element nodes we can selecting by** their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 

DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nodelist. 

We can access and update an element node content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques. 

An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.

The implementation of the DOM is inconsistent in older browsers. 

Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
