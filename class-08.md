# More CSS Layout

When we want to containing elements to group together sections of a page, we often use **div tag** elements. 

Browsers usually display pages in normal flow unless when we  specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

When we want to moves content to the left or right of the page, we use float property, and can be used to create multi-column layouts, and its items require a defined width.

The layout of pages can be fixed width or liquid.

- There are different ways to position elements on our web page such as normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
- Various devices have different screen sizes and resolution, which are affecting on the design process.
- We use grids to make our web page designs look more professional.

- We use fixed width layout when we don't want to change the size of elementwhen the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window, and its measured by pixels.
- We use liquid layout to make the element flexable with the screen size when the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window, and its measured by percentages.
