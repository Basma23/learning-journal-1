# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text
## HTML Images
We can Include an image on our web page by using HTML through **img tag** even by using CSS through the property of background-image. 

We can pick the format of the image which we want to use, show it at the right size, and optimize it to make pages load faster.

img tag has two attributes **src** to indicate the source of an image, and an **alt** to describe the content of an image.

We should save our images at the size which we will use them on our web page and in the appropriate format.
## CSS Color
# What is CSS? 
### Why are the colors important? 

We are adding color to our HTML pages by using CSS to give a life for our pages and to help our visitors to understand what are we working on.

**To specify the colors in CSS we have three ways which are these:**
- by RGB values.
- hex codes.
- the name of the color. 

Also the color pickers tool can help us to find our color that we are looking for.

The contrast is very **important** between any text and the background color; to make our page clear to our visitors.
## Text
**There are two types of markup to write a text by using HTML:**
- **Structural markup:** all elements that we can use them to describe both headings and paragraphs.
- **Semantic markup:** all elements that provides extra information such as emphasis element, quotation element, and so on.
**So, we use the HTML elements to describe the structure of the page.**
With text in HTML we can  control the choices of font, size, weight, style, and spacing by using its properties thruogh CSS.

The font has a limited choices.

We can control the spaces between lines of the text, individual letters, and words. 

We can aligned our text to the left, right, center, or justified,and it can also be indented.

We can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when our user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
