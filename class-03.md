#  HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow
## HTML Lists
**There are three types to write a list in our web page when we need to use it by HTML and they are:**
- **Ordered list:** each item in this type of list is start with a numbere or .character that indicate order
- **Unordered list:** each item in this type of list is start with a bullet point.
- **Definition list:** this type of list is consist of a set of terms with definitions for each of these terms.

**Each list can contain onother list inside it.**
## CSS Boxes
**CSS deals with each HTML element as if it has its own box, so we can do several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes.** 

***We can do:***
- Control the dimensions of our boxes.
- Create borders around boxes.
- Set margins and padding for boxes.
- Show and hide boxes.
## JS Control Flow
- When we want to do a decision making about what we want to do next we use conditional statements.
- We use the comparison operators when we want to to compare two variables.
- When we want to combine more than one set of comparison operators we use logical operators. 
- When we want to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false we use if .. else statments. 
- When we want to compare a value against possible outcomes and also provides a default option if none match we use switch statements.
