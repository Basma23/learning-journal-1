# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions
## HTML Links
We can move between the web pages through links which defining the feature of the web. 

When we want to do linking on our website, we use **anchor** tag. We can specify which page we want to link to using the href attribute.

**We can use links to:**
- Link from a website to another.
- Link from a page to another in the same website.
- Link from a part to another in the same web page.
- Link for opening on a new browser window.
- Link for starting up our email program and address a new email to someone.
## CSS Layout
When we want to containing elements to group together sections of a page, we often use **div tag** elements. 

Browsers usually display pages in normal flow unless when we  specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

When we want to moves content to the left or right of the page, we use float property, and can be used to create multi-column layouts, and its items require a defined width.

The layout of pages can be fixed width or liquid.

Grids help us to create professional and flexible designs.
## JS Functions
We can group a set of related statements together that represent a single task by using **functions**. 

Functions can take parameters and may return a value.

The series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around us we called it **object**.

The properties of the object are **variables** ; and the methods of the object are **functions**. 

Web browsers execute objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded in the browser window.

JavaScript also contains many embedded objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Its features and methods provide scripting functionality.

When we want to create a  sets of complex data, we use arrays and objects, and each one can contain the other one.
